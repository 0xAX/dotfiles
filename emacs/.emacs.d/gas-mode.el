;;; Commentary:

;; To use this mode, put gas-mode.el somewhere on your load-path.
;; Then add this to your .emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'gas-mode)
;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.S\\'" . gas-mode))

;; gas-mode recognizes gas syntax (including embedded C preprocessor
;; directives).  It does a limited amount of parsing, so it can do
;; some fancy things with syntactic elements (like labels).  It,
;; however does not know about the peculiarities of the special
;; processor you're writing code for (there are just too many of
;; them), so, for example, it can't tell register names from labels.
;; Also, its scope is limited to the file you are editing.
;;
;; Symbol highlighting: For a symbol to be recognized as such, it must
;; be in a field where (as per gas syntax) symbols can be placed
;; (i.e. label field, argument field, some directives).  If point
;; rests on such a symbol and there are more of it in the current
;; buffer, it is highlighted and you can move forward and backward
;; between all places where that symbol is referenced or defined with
;; forward-sexp and backward-sexp.  
;;
;; This is different from a simple string search in that only those
;; places are considered where the symbol is actually used.  For local
;; labels, gas-mode resolves which references are associated with
;; which location and only highlights those that fit.  The
;; highlighting is different for different types of symbols; see the
;; customization buffer for the gas-symbol-* faces for short
;; explanations of their meanings.
;;
;; Special forms of local labels (like `55$') are not (yet?)
;; supported.

;; A special feature may need some explanation: C passthroughs.
;; Assembler code is often used to write functions that are later
;; called by C programs.  For this to work, you usually have to
;; maintain two files, one containing the assembler source, the other
;; holding the C interface declaration.  C passthroughs allow you to
;; move the C declaration part into the assembler file next to the
;; function it belongs to.
;;
;; From the assembler's point of view, C passthroughs are just C syntax
;; comments with some small syntactic sugar added, like:
;;
;; /*C
;;     int a_declaration(void);
;;     extern volatile int another_declaration;
;;
;;     /# and this will be passed as comment #/
;; */
;;
;; Note the `/*C' at the beginning and the `/# ... #/' for the nested
;; comment.
;;
;; It is then up to the Make process to generate a .h file, which
;; carries the declarations and the comment, changing the "/#" and "#/"
;; into "/*" and "*/".
;;
;; This may be done by including a line similar to the following into
;; your Makefile (assuming $(ASFILES) is a list of your assembly
;; language files) (and don't forget to use a TAB for the white space
;; which introduces the action lines (<TAB> echo ..., <TAB>sed -n ...):
;;
;; asm-C-defs.h: $(ASFILES)
;;	echo '/* Definitions of assembly language functions */' > $@
;;	echo '/* (automatically created by make)            */' >> $@
;; 	sed -n '/[/][*]C/,/[*][/]/{s|/[*]C||;s|[*]/||;s|/#|/*|;s|#/|*/|;p}' \
;;                $^ >> $@
;; 
;; (Note the above code requires the "/*C" and "*/" to be on a line of
;; their own.)  gas-mode recognizes this kind of comment by proper
;; syntax highlighting.  Symbol highlighting is also supported.  For a
;; symbol to be highlighted within C passthrough code, it must be
;; defined to be global (because only then it is visible to an
;; external C program) in the same buffer.

;;
;; This mode runs `gas-mode-hook' when initialization is complete.
;;  

;; Bugs:
;;
;;    Most probably, yes.  You'll tell me (<hcz@hczim.de>).
;;
;;    This code is *not tested at all* for syntaxes where
;;    `gas-commant-char' differs from `?;'.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;;    2007-05-26  1st public release (hcz).
;;
;;    2007-05-30  docstrings, commentary, 
;;                open string recognition with gas-next-token/limit-re.
;;
;;    2007-12-05  Bug with Intel syntax in arguemnt field fixed

Commands:

\(Some of these commands may exhibit slightly different behaviour if point
is on a C syntax line.)

\\[indent-for-tab-command]  indent the field(s) point is on.  If it already is in its position, 
  move on to the next field on the line.

\\[gas-indent-backward]  Move to the previous field.

\\[gas-comment]  When no region is active, starts a comment sequence:
  - If a comment is present and point is not at its start, jump there.
  - Else start a comment.  If there already is one, increase its comment level.
    What that is and what it does, is best explained when you try
    it out: Move to en empty line, then type \\[gas-comment] and
    then repeatedly \\[gas-comment] or \\[gas-comment-char].
  Calls \\[gas-comment-dwim] (see below) if the region is active.

\\[forward-sexp]  If you're on a highlighted symbol, jump to its next 
  occurence.  Else do `forward-sexp' like in text mode.

\\[backward-sexp]  If you're on a highlighted symbol, jump to its previous
  occurence.  Else do `backward-sexp' like in text mode.

\\[gas-comment-dwim] If the region starts at the leading white space
  before a comment, all full-line comments in region will be
  removed.  If the region starts on a comment, comments will be
  removed, but comments with leading white space will be left
  untouched.  Else insert triple variable `gas-comment-char's before all
  lines in region.

\\[fill-paragraph] beautifies the paragraph around
  point, i.e. it adjusts all assembly syntax fields to their
  standard positions.

\\[indent-region]  beautifies the region, i.e., adjusts all fields in region.


The following characters have a special meaning in special cases:

\\[gas-colon]  if it terminates a label:  outdent the label and
  move to opcode column.  Else, just insert \\[gas-colon] as usual.

\\[gas-comment-char]  The value which introduces an asm style comment.
  If typed in in a row after \\[gas-comment], behaves as an alias to \\[gas-comment].  else
  just insert \\[gas-comment-char].
  Can be customized to always act as alias (`gas-comment-char-starts-comment').

  Alternatively, you may use a File Variable to make it buffer local
  (which allows you to use different syntaxes in the same session).
  Note:  Setting it to a value other than ?\; has not yet been tested.

\\[gas-hash]  If it starts a preprocessor directive:  Outdent it to first
  column.

Customization:  Entry on this mode runs `gas-mode-hook'.
The customization group is called 'gas'.

  "Parse the line point is on, element by element.
The returned list holds a list of syntactic elements (fields)
found, in the order of appearance.  Each syntactic element is
represented by a list holding 7 elements:

'(TYPE SUBTYPE BEG-COL TEXT-COL END-COL TEXT MODIFIED)
    0 - 'type: ('label, 'opcode ...)
    1 - 'subtype: (additional information required by some types)
    2 - 'beg-col: first slot (column #) (usually occupied by white 
                  space before text)
    3 - 'text-col: first text slot (column #)

    5 - 'text: text contents (nil if empty)
    6 - 'modified: nil (will later reflect if rearrangement (indentation) 
        is required / was done).

Terminology: A single list of these 7 elements is called a
`field' throughout gas-mode.el.  `fields' as symbol name (or part
of a symbol name) means it stands for a variable bound to a list
of `field' lists which, in order of appearance, describe a
complete source line.

Note that text-col may lie outside (on the right side of) the
range beg-col ... end-col if there's no actual text (it is the
column where text would have to go to).

Don't assume a fixed element position except for 'type, which is
always the car of the list.  Instead, use `gas-nth' to extract
elements by their symbolic names ('type, 'subtype, ...)."
