This package lets you access the GNU Bug Tracker from within Emacs.

It defines the command `M-x debbugs-gnu' for listing bugs, and the
command `M-x debbugs-gnu-search' for bug searching.  The command
`M-x debbugs-gnu-usertags' shows existing user tags on bugs.  In order
to show bugs with known numbers, `M-x debbugs-gnu-bugs' could be used.

If you prefer the listing of bugs as TODO items of `org-mode', you
could use the commands `M-x debbugs-org', `M-x debbugs-org-search' and
`M-x debbugs-org-bugs' instead.

A minor mode `debbugs-browse-mode' let you browse URLs to the GNU Bug
Tracker as well as bug identifiers prepared for `bug-reference-mode'.

This package works by implementing basic functions to access a Debbugs
SOAP server (see <http://wiki.debian.org/DebbugsSoapInterface>).  It
implements the SOAP functions "get_bugs", "newest_bugs", "get_status",
"get_usertag", "get_bug_log" and "search_est".  The SOAP function
"get_versions" is not implemented (yet).

You can connect to other debbugs servers by customizing the variable
`debbugs-port'.
