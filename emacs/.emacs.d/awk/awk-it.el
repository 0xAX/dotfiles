;;; Commentary:

;; AWK it! allows you to see AWK output as you are typing the script;
;; it sends selected region to awk and uses yasnippet as interactive UI.

;; There are 3 modes of AWK code: simplified syntax(default, see below),
;; single line AWK syntax (regular AWK syntax but only inside the default
;; match) and raw AWK syntax(full AWK code). AWK it! can transfrom code
;; from one mode to another(not perfect, but it will make an effort) and
;; there is also support for multiple lines. Data is expanded with selected
;; yasnippet expand keybinding.

;;; Usage:

;; Simplest usage is selecting region and running M-x awk-it.
;; Default field separator is space. AWK it! matches every non empty
;; row in region ($0 !~ /^$/).

;; After invoking command buffer will change to show the following interface:

;; Data: <First line with most fields>
;; AWK pattern: <AWK code; may be multiple lines without extra formatting>
;; <AWK output>

;; Example:

;; From:

;; John 26 London
;; Mark 27 Seattle 50
;; Scott 26 Sydney

;; to (ignoring the extra field in example pattern):

;; Data: Mark 27 Seattle 50
;; AWK pattern: <person name="$1" age="$2">
;;     <location>$3</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="John" age="26">
;;     <location>London</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Mark" age="27">
;;     <location>Seattle</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Scott" age="26">
;;     <location>Sydney</location>
;; </person>

;; and after expansion:

;; <person name="John" age="26">
;;     <location>London</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Mark" age="27">
;;     <location>Seattle</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Scott" age="26">
;;     <location>Sydney</location>
;; </person>

;; The expanded lines are automaticaly indented. Buffer undo goes back to
;; before awk-it invocation (both options can be changed).

;; During completion the folowing options are available:
;;   - C-c s - change field separator
;;   - C-c t - toggle space and tab trimming around custom field separator
;;   - C-c <up> - next AWK it! mode (simple -> single -> raw -> simple -> ...)
;;   - C-c <down> - previous AWK it! mode (raw -> single -> simple -> raw ...)

;; After completion you can run:
;;   - M-x awk-it-to-kill-ring - copies last AWK code to kill ring
;;   - M-x awk-it-to-file - copies last AWK code(raw or converted to raw) to file

;; Simplified AWK code differs from regular in that it:
;;   - prints code(print "<code>")
;;   - escapes double and single quotes (latter for shell interaction)
;;   - escapes newline
;;   - concatenates fields with rest of the text

;; The single mode is regular AWK code run for each default match. The previous
;; example written in single AWK code would be:

;; print "<person name=\"" $1 "\" age=\"" $2 "\">\n\
;;     <location>" $3 "</location>\n\
;; </person>"

;; The raw mode is raw, or full, AWK code needed for data processing. The previous
;; example would be:

;; $0 !~ /^$/ {
;;     print "<person name=\"" $1 "\" age=\"" $2 "\">\n\
;;     <location>" $3 "</location>\n\
;; </person>";
;; }
;;
;; /^$/ { print }

;; AWK it! can also be invoked with every mode as starting mode, with custom
;; separator, with contents of file inserted in interactive UI code field(in
;; raw mode), or automatically process region with contents of file(as raw AWK).

;; Combining everything the following functions are available:
;;   - awk-it                             - basic AWK it! - starts in simple mode
;;   - awk-it-with-separator              - simple mode with custom field separator
;;   - awk-it-single                      - single mode AWK it!
;;   - awk-it-single-with-separator       - single mode with custom field separator
;;   - awk-it-raw                         - AWK it! using raw(full) AWK syntax
;;   - awk-it-file                        - automatically transform with AWK file
;;   - awk-it-with-file                   - raw mode with code from AWK file
;;   - awk-it-to-kill-ring                - place last AWK code in kill ring
;;   - awk-it-to-file                     - output last raw AWK code to file

;; Also AWK it! can be customized in External -> Awk it:
;;   - awk-it-load-hook; Hook that gets run after the AWK it! has been loaded
;;   - awk-it-default-separator           - default AWK field separator - ' '
;;   - awk-it-default-row-filter          - default AWK row filter - '$0 !~ /^$/'
;;   - awk-it-file-first-line             - first line inserted in AWK file
;;   - awk-it-default-mode                - default starting mode for awk-it
;;   - awk-it-undo                        - toggles if undo ignores AWK it! edits
;;   - awk-it-indent                      - toggles is expanded text will be indented
;;   - awk-it-extra-awk-code              - extra AWK code that is inserted in raw AWK
;;   - awk-it-toggle-trim-keybinding      - keybinding for toggling trimming
;;   - awk-it-field-separator-keybinding  - keybinding for change field separator
;;   - awk-it-next-mode-keybinding        - keybinding for next mode
;;   - awk-it-previous-mode-keybinding    - keybinding for previousmode

;;; Change Log:
