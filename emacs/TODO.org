* Things to improve in Emacs configuration 
** org-mode
*** TODO C-down/left/right/up does not move between windows
need to rebind it
** make-mode
*** TODO CUA copy/paste does not work for now
It looks like it is binded to something else, it would be good
to check it and unbind
** e-mail
*** TODO finish GNUS configuration
** lisp
*** TODO add keybidning for slime-load-system
** miscellaneous
*** TODO text between brackets not highlighted with solarized colors
but should be
*** TODO make help in README.md in dotfiles/.emacs with description of current configuration
*** TODO take a look at [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]]

it might be better replacement for ido
*** TODO consider to use **use-package** instead of putting everything to .emacs.d
